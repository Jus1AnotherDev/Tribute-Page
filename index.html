        <h2>Life and Education</h2>
        <p>Hilleman was born on a farm near high plains town of Miles City, Montana, USA. His parents were Anna and Gustav Hilleman.  His parents were Anna and Gustav Hillemann, and he was their eighth child. His twin sister died when he was born, and his mother died two days later. He was raised in the nearby household of his uncle, Robert Hilleman, and worked in his youth on the family farm. He credited much of his success to his work with chickens as a boy; since the 1930s, fertile chicken eggs had often been used to grow viruses for vaccines.</p>
            <p>Due to lack of money Hilleman almost couldn't attend college. is eldest brother interceded, and Hilleman graduated first in his class in 1941 from Montana State University with family help and scholarships. He won a fellowship to the University of Chicago and received his doctoral degree in microbiology in 1944.</p><br>
        <h2>A time line of his career and achievements:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>1948 to 1957:</b> Developed vaccines against Japanese B encephalitis and a mutanat of Influenza virus.</li><br>
            <li><b>1957:</b> Hilleman joined Merck & Co., as head of its new virus and cell biology research department in West Point, Pennsylvania, USA, and developed most of the forty experimental and licensed animal and human vaccines with which he is credited.</li><br>
            <li><b>1963:</b>  His daughter Jeryl Lynn came down with the mumps. He cultivated material from her, and used it as the basis of a mumps vaccine. The Jeryl Lynn strain of the mumps vaccine is still used today. The strain is currently used in the trivalent (measles, mumps and rubella) MMR vaccine that he also developed, the first vaccine ever approved incorporating multiple live virus strains.</li><br>
            <li><b>1981:</b> He and his group nvented a vaccine for hepatitis B by treating blood serum with pepsin, urea and formaldehyde.  \This vaccine is still in use today. By 2003, 150 countries were using it and the incidence of the disease in the United States in young people had decreased by 95%. Hilleman considered his work on this vaccine to be his <b>single greatest achievement</b>.</li><br>
            <li><b>1984:</b> Hilleman was an adviser to the World Health Organization. He retired as senior vice president of the Merck Research Labs in 1984 at the mandatory retirement age of 65. He then directed the newly created Merck Institute for Vaccinology where he worked for the next twenty years.</li><br>
            <li><b>2005:</b> At the time of his death in Philadelphia on April 11, 2005,[8] at the age of 85, Hilleman was Adjunct Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>A quote from Hilleman summing up his ethos. <q>Well, looking back on one’s lifetime, you say, ‘Gee, what have I done—have I done enough for the world to justify having been here?’ That’s a big worry—to people from Montana, at least. And I would say I’m kind of pleased about all this. I would do it over again because there’s great joy in being useful</q></p><br>
        <p>The number of lives that Hilleman’s vaccines have saved is immeasurable—one estimate has put it at 8 million lives each year.</p><br>
